## âœ… Todayâ€™s Focus:
Understanding and implementing `localStorage` to save and retrieve user data.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered:
- What is `localStorage` and why use it?
- Storing data using `localStorage.setItem()`
- Retrieving data using `localStorage.getItem()`
- Using `JSON.stringify()` and `JSON.parse()` to handle objects
- Displaying data on page load

## ðŸ“š Resources:
- ðŸ§  FreeCodeCamp: [Use Local Storage](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/use-local-storage-in-modern-applications/)
- ðŸŽ¥ YouTube: [localStorage Tutorial â€“ FreeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwicscsvGLg)
- ðŸ“– MDN Docs: [Web Storage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API)

## ðŸ›  How It Works:
1. On page load, the script checks if user data is saved in localStorage.
2. If data exists, it's parsed and displayed in the UI.
3. A button allows the user to enter their name, email, and age using `prompt()`.
4. That data is stored in localStorage and shown on the page.

## ðŸ§ª Example UI:
```
Welcome, Amna (amna@email.com, Age: 21)!
[Enter Your Info]
```

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used:
- HTML (for structure)
- JavaScript only (no CSS)
- localStorage API
- `prompt()` for user input
- DOM manipulation

- GitHub repository link âœ…
- Console + browser screenshot âœ…
- Shared summary on LinkedIn âœ…
