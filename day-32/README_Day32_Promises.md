# 📅 Day 32 – JavaScript Promises

## 🎯 Goals for Today
- Understand how Promises work.
- Learn `.then()`, `.catch()` and chaining.
- Refactor async app from async/await to use Promises.

## 📚 Learning Resources (4 Hours)
- ✅ FreeCodeCamp – JavaScript Promises (2h)
- ✅ YouTube – “JavaScript Promises” by The Net Ninja / Web Dev Simplified (1h)
- ✅ MDN Docs – Promises (1h)

## 🛠 Task Instructions
Refactor the weather app or any async app to use Promises:

### ✅ Required Steps:
- Use `.then()` for handling success.
- Use `.catch()` for handling errors.
- Chain multiple `.then()` if needed.

### 🔁 Compare & Test Both Versions
Test the async/await version and the Promise version side-by-side.  
💡 Note which one is easier to read and debug.

## 📂 Files
- `main.js` – Contains the refactored social media simulation app using Promises and async/await.

## ✅ Status: Completed
- [x] All functions converted to return Promises.
- [x] Used .then() chaining with .catch().
- [x] async/await version provided for comparison.
