# 🐞 Day 26 – JavaScript Debugging & Bug Fixing

📅 **Date:** 16th July 2025  
📁 **Topic:** Debugging JavaScript Code like a Pro

---

## 📌 Task Objective

Learn how to properly debug and fix errors in JavaScript code using browser tools and logging strategies.

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

### ✅ Key Concepts:
- Using **Browser DevTools** (Chrome/Firefox)
- Setting **Breakpoints** to pause and inspect code
- **Console Logging** best practices
- Identifying and fixing **common JavaScript errors** (ReferenceError, TypeError, etc.)

---

## 💻 Practical Implementation

I created a **Simple Calculator** app that adds two numbers.  
Initially, the code had bugs, which I identified and fixed step by step using debugging tools.

### 🔍 Bugs Fixed:
1. `.value` was missing while accessing input values  
2. String inputs were not converted to numbers → used `parseFloat()`  
3. Typo in variable name: `reslt` → corrected to `result`  
4. Final output not displaying → fixed `innerText` for result paragraph

## 🧪 Demo Code Structure

- `index.html` – Contains input fields, button, and result display
- `script.js` – Handles logic with debug comments and `console.log()` for tracing

---

## 📸 Screenshots (Optional)
_Add screenshots of console logs, breakpoints, or corrected UI if submitting this to a repository._

## 🧠 Debugging Tip

> “Don’t just fix the bug — understand **why** it happened and how to prevent it next time.”
